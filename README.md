# Getting started

 - Build application docker image: `npm run build:docker`
 - Run application in PRODUCTION mode: `npm start`
 - Run application in DEVELOPMENT mode: `npm run dev:docker`
 - Run local tests: `npm run test`
 - Run CI tests: `npm run test:docker`

# Understanding the application

I've designed this application with using all my current best practices and principles. I hope you enjoy reviewing as much as I've enjoyed writing it. Any feedback is appreciated

I believe in the concept of _living documentation_ and that the best source of 
documentation for any software is its test suite. Therefore, you should easily understand
what the app does by looking at the test folder.
